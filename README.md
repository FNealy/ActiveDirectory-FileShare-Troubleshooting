# File Share & NTFS Permissions Troubleshooting

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This lab demonstrates **help desk tasks related to shared network folders in Active Directory**.  
The goal is to simulate real-world scenarios where users may have trouble accessing shared files and show how to troubleshoot and fix NTFS and Share-level permissions.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Architecture
- **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)**: `10.0.0.0/24`  
- **Virtual Machines**:
  - `DC-1` â†’ Domain Controller + DNS + File Share  
  - `Client-1` â†’ Domain-joined workstation  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features Implemented
âœ… Created shared folder on DC-1: `\\DC-1\FinanceShare`  
âœ… Applied **NTFS and Share-level permissions** for HR group  
âœ… Simulated access issues for non-HR users  
âœ… Troubleshot permission errors and verified access

### 5. Test Access as Non-HR User
- Log in as **Charlie** (or other non-HR user)

### 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **Issue:** HR user cannot write to share  
  - **Fix:** Check NTFS and Share permissions, ensure user is member of HR group, run `gpupdate /force` on client
